### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Chris-Boyle-94/Chris-Boyle-94** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Final Fantasy XIV item search application. Check out the pinned repo 'ffxiv-search-items'. It's also deployed here: https://moghead.herokuapp.com/
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about React, Express, and PostgreSQL. I'm interested in learning more about blockchain, lower level languages, and honestly anything involving code and programming. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play drums on the side for about 12 years. I love creating and playing music!
