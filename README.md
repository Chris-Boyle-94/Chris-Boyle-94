### Hi there I'm Chris, a software engineer that can't get enough of it. I love everything innvolving programming and coding (which is what I spend 99% of my time on). I also love all kinds of music, good and bad, and art too!
My goal as a developer is to make things that I think are fun and interesting but also helpful to others.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Final Fantasy XIV item search application. Check out the pinned repo 'ffxiv-search-items'. It's also deployed here: https://moghead.herokuapp.com/
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about React, Express, and PostgreSQL. I'm interested in learning more about blockchain, lower level languages, and honestly anything involving code and programming. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play drums on the side for about 12 years. I love creating and playing music!
